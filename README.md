FinalProject
--------------
Final project for one of my courses. Was done in one evening so it doesn't use any php and just a small piece of JS. Mostly
just HTML and a template. I'm big into gardening so this is a site I am currently imroving on and will update as I go but chances
are that I'll start from scratch since this one is extremely poorly made.
