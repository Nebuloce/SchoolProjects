                         <p>Sweet, starchy sweet potatoes are treats when fried.
                            Supermarket berries tend to be tart with grainy texture; this is 
                            because the natural sugar in the berries begins converting to starch
                            as soon as it is plucked from the plant.
                        </p>
                            Strawberry plants come in three types but for home gardens Junebearer is recommended.
                            Although you will have to wait a year for fruit hal be well worth it. <br>
       

                        <h1>Planting</h1>
                          <p>Buy disease-resistant s from a reputable nursery, of a variety 
                            recommended in your area.<br>
                            Plan to plant as soon as the ground can be
                            worked in the Spring. See your local frost dates.<br>
                            Strawberries are sprawlingSeedlings will send out runners, or
                            daughter plantsand wide enough to accommodate the entire root system 
                            without bending it. <br> 
                            However, don't plant too deep: The roots should be covered, but the crown should 
                            be right at the soil surface.<br>
                            Provide adequate space for sprawling. Set plants out 20 inches apart, and leave 4 
                            feet between rows.<br>
                            Roots shouldn't be longer than 8 inches when plants are set out. Trim them if 
                            necessary. <br>
                      
                            Practice crop rotation for the most success. Do not plant in a site that recently 
                            had strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, or eggplant.<br>
                            Establish new plants each year to keep berry quality high each season.<br>
                            It is also possible to grow strawberries from last year's runners.
                        </p>
                         <h1>Lifetime Care</h1>
                        <p>This is sas tobe the blah blah blah. <br>
                            If not allowed to bear fruit, they last spend their food reserves on 
                            developing healthy roots. <br>
                            The yields will be much greater in the second year.<br>
                            Eliminate daughter plants as last. First and ions produce 
                            higher yields. Try to space each plant about 10 inches apart.<br>
                            Moisture is incredibly important dw roots. <br>
                            Water adequately, aer week. Strawberry plants need a lot of water when the runners and 
                            flowers are developing and againd weed invasion.<br>
                            Be diligent about weeding. Weed by hand, especially in the first months after 
                            planting.<br>
