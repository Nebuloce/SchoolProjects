                        <h1>Starting</h1>
                         <p>Sweet, juicy strawberries are treats when right off the plant.
                            Supermarket berries tend to be tart with grainy texture; this is 
                            because the natural sugar in the berries begins converting to starch
                            as soon as it is plucked from the plant.
                        </p>
                            Strawberry plants come in three types but for home gardens Junebearer is recommended.
                            Although you will have to wait a year for fruit harvesting, it will be well worth it. <br>
                        <blockquote>Junebearer: Length-of-day sensitive, these varieties 
                            produce buds in the autumn, flowers and fruits the following 
                            spring, and runners during the long days of summer.</blockquote>

                        <h1>Planting</h1>
                          <p>Buy disease-resistant plants from a reputable nursery, of a variety 
                            recommended in your area.<br>
                            Plan to plant as soon as the ground can be
                            worked in the Spring. See your local frost dates.<br>
                            Strawberries are sprawling plants. Seedlings will send out runners, or
                            daughter plants, which in turn will send out their own runners.<br>
                            Make planting holes deep and wide enough to accommodate the entire root system 
                            without bending it. <br> 
                            However, don't plant too deep: The roots should be covered, but the crown should 
                            be right at the soil surface.<br>
                            Provide adequate space for sprawling. Set plants out 20 inches apart, and leave 4 
                            feet between rows.<br>
                            Roots shouldn't be longer than 8 inches when plants are set out. Trim them if 
                            necessary. <br>
                            pH should be between 5.5 and 7. If necessary, amend your soil in advance. <br>
                            Strawberry plants require 6-10 hours a day of direct sunlight, so choose your 
                            planting site accordingly.<br>
                            Tolerant of different soil types, although prefer loam. Begin working in aged 
                            manure or compost a couple months before planting. <br>
                            Planting site must be well-drained. Raised beds are a particularly good option for 
                            strawberry plants.<br>
                            Practice crop rotation for the most success. Do not plant in a site that recently 
                            had strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, or eggplant.<br>
                            Establish new plants each year to keep berry quality high each season.<br>
                            It is also possible to grow strawberries from last year's runners.
                        </p>
                         <h1>Lifetime Care</h1>
                        <p>In the first year, pick off blossoms to discourage strawberry plants from 
                            fruiting. <br>
                            If not allowed to bear fruit, they will spend their food reserves on 
                            developing healthy roots. <br>
                            The yields will be much greater in the second year.<br>
                            Eliminate daughter plants as needed. First and second generations produce 
                            higher yields. Try to space each plant about 10 inches apart.<br>
                            Moisture is incredibly important due to shallow roots. <br>
                            Water adequately, about one inch per week. Strawberry plants need a lot of water when the runners and 
                            flowers are developing and again in the fall when the plants are mature.<br>
                            Keep the beds mulched to reduce water needs and weed invasion.<br>
                            Be diligent about weeding. Weed by hand, especially in the first months after 
                            planting.<br>
                            When the growing season is over, mow or cut foliage down to one inch and mulch 
                            plants about 4 inches deep with straw, pine needles or other organic material. <br>
                            This can be done after the first couple of frosts, or when air temps reach 
                            20Â° F. Remove mulch in early spring, after danger of frost has passed.<br>
                            Row covers are a good option for protecting blossoms and fruit from birds.
